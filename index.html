        Irish family’s ‘prayer’ answered over Xmas as Clare woman, 29, in coma after hol accident wakes with ‘positive signs’
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ruairi, who has described Aoife as warm and adventurous, said: “After a previous attempt to wake Aoife was unsuccessful, we’re incredibly grateful to share that today (December 26) she was brought out of her coma.”<br>
<br>
“She is now awake and showing really positive signs, right in line with what doctors would hope for after everything she’s been through. Above all else, our biggest prayer was for Aoife to wake up, and that prayer has been answered.”<br>
<br>
“Now that she’s awake, further tests can be carried out, and we’ll begin to get a clearer picture of the road ahead. We have been overwhelmed by the messages, prayers, kindness, and generosity shown to Aoife and our family.”

        GTA 6 Release Date Scheduled for November 19th 2026
      </h2>
      <p>
        Rockstar Games have announced that the highly anticipated sixth edition of Grand Theft Auto will be released later this year on the 19th of November 2026. The game was initially meant to be released in the Summer of 2026, however like several times before the release date was pushed back to ensure readjustments could be made on time. This had left a lot of fans disappointed as the release of GTA 6 in the summer would’ve been great for during summer holidays and the 2026 World Cup.<br>
<br>
GTA 6 will mainly be set in the fictional state Leonida which is based on the state of Florida and the main city will be Vice City which is meant to imitate Miami.
